Timestamps are unreliable and could come unordered.

Provided Kafka and Zookeeper images do not work for ARM, using official Confluent images instead.

To increase throughput, partition on device id

TODO:
- Environment variables
- Extract worker code to be nice
- REST API endpoints
- Worker needs local cache with state and latest_seen
- Postgres should use Timescale DB
- Migrations to create hypertable
- Can we get rid of kafka metadata in the table?
- Explain connector stuff in config and docker compose, cleanout unused stuff


Future steps
- OTEL, logs, traces, metrics (especially throughput and response time percentiles)
- Scale up Kafka partitions, it is hard to move data to a different partition
