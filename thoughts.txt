Timestamps are unreliable and could come unordered.

Provided Kafka and Zookeeper images do not work for ARM, using official Confluent images instead.

To increase throughput, partition on device id

TODO:
- Write readme explainer
    - Changes to original files
    - How to setup and run
    - Screenshot of Architecture



Future steps
- OTEL, logs, traces, metrics (especially throughput and response time percentiles)
- Scale up Kafka partitions, it is hard to move data to a different partition, can never downscale partitions
- All Kafka handlers are susceptible to the poison pill problem, this needs fixing
- waitForBrokers should be expanded to all workers, brokers may not be the same
- Broker strings should be checked to work with multiple brokers
- DB migrator needs to handle rollbacks

Cameras track if a single device enters or exits.

State checking speeds
- New compacted topic for events, local cache client
- New compacted topic for events, redis cache


Can update the local cache only if the publication succeeds

Do we need sync.Map? No, because one consumer group per partiion
